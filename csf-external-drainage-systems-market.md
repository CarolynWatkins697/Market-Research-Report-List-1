<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CSF External Drainage Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Ventricular Drainage (EVD) Systems</li><li>Lumbar Drainage (LD) Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CSF external drainage systems primarily include External Ventricular Drainage (EVD) systems and Lumbar Drainage (LD) systems. EVD systems are used to manage intracranial pressure by draining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) directly from the ventricles of the brain, addressing conditions like hydrocephalus. In contrast, Lumbar Drainage systems drain CSF from the lumbar region of the spine, often for diagnostic purposes or to manage conditions affecting the spinal cord. Both systems play crucial roles in neurosurgical procedures and critical care management.</p></p>
