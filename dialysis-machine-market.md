<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dialysis Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li><li>Hemodialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dialysis machine market comprises two primary types: peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis involves the infusion of a sterile solution into the abdominal cavity, allowing waste removal through the peritoneum. This method offers greater patient autonomy and can be performed at home. Hemodialysis, on the other hand, utilizes a machine to filter blood through an artificial kidney, requiring sessions at clinics or hospitals. Both methods are essential for managing kidney failure and enhancing patients' quality of life.</p></p>
