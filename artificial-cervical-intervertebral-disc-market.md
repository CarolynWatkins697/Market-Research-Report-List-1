<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Cervical Intervertebral Disc Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biopolymer Material</li><li>Metal Material</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Artificial Cervical Intervertebral Disc market features two primary material types: biopolymer and metal. Biopolymer materials, often derived from natural or synthetic polymers, offer flexibility and biocompatibility, mimicking the mechanical properties of natural discs. They promote better integration with surrounding tissue. In contrast, metal materials, typically made from titanium or cobalt-chromium alloys, provide robust strength and durability but may raise concerns about biocompatibility and long-term wear. Both types aim to restore motion and alleviate pain in cervical spine disorders.</p></p>
